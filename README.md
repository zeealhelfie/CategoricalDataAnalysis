## Problem Statement

In this project, we aim to build a classification model to predict whether mushrooms are edible or poisonous based on various features. This is a binary classification problem.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about 8,124 mushrooms with 23 different attributes, including cap shape, cap surface, odor, gill color, and more. The target variable is "class," which indicates whether a mushroom is edible ("e") or poisonous ("p").

## Logistic Regression Model

We start by fitting a logistic regression model using all available predictors.

## Feature Selection and Model Diagnostics

- We will perform feature selection to identify the best subset of variables.
- A diagnostic on the best model will be conducted to assess its performance.
- We will perform various statistical inferences on the model's coefficients and parameters.

## Predictions and Confusion Tables

- Using the selected model, we will make predictions.
- We will vary the pi_0 values as cut-off points to create confusion tables for classification.

## Data Visualization

We will visualize the data and the model's performance through various plots and graphs.

## ROC Curve and AUC

- We will plot the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.
- Calculate the Area Under the Curve (AUC) to evaluate the model's discriminative ability.
- Find the best cut-off point for classification based on the ROC curve.

## Cross-Validation

- We will perform Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) and k-fold cross-validation to assess the model's robustness.

## Probit and Identity Links

- We will try using the probit and identity links to model the data.
- Compare the performance of these models to determine which works better for this dataset.

## Model Comparison

We will compare the logistic regression, probit regression, and identity regression models to identify the most effective model for this data.

## Contingency Table Analysis

If applicable, we will apply methods for contingency tables to analyze grouped data, such as Chi-squared tests, G^2 tests, and more.
