# Categorical Data Analysis Final Project: Math449
## Clustering of Categorical Data: Mushroom Classification

***    

### In this project we will be building  a logistic regression model, and following these analysis instructions:
1. State the problem and describe the data set
2. Fit a logistic regression model with all predictors
3. Select the best subset of variables. Perform a diagnostic on the best model.  Perform all possible inferences you can think about.
4. Use the new model to make predictions.
5. Use different pi_0 as a cut-off point and create a confusion table.
6. Perform visualization of data and models.  
7. Plot the ROC curve, find AUC and the best cutoff point for classification.
8. Perform LOOCV and k-fold cross-validation.
9. Try the probit link and the identity links to model data.  
10. Which model works better for this data?
11. If you have grouped data, use the methods for contingency tables to analyze the data (Chi sq test, G^2, and so on if applicable).
12. Write a report
